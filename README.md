# Python modules

- Python library and built-in functions
- What is pip and how do we use it
- APIs with Python
- Built-in functions help accelerate software development

### Python libraries and built-in functions
- built-in functions are imported from python libraries using ```import```
- examples:
    - ```import random``` - imports random method from python library 
    - ```import math``` - imports built-in math functions
- after importing, we can call built-in functions
```
random.random() # generates a random number between 0 and 1
math.floor(num_float) # takes a number and rounds it down
math.ceil(num_float) # takes a number and rounds it up
```
